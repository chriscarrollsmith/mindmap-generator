## Scope

This report details Fitch Ratings' criteria for assigning new and maintaining existing ratings to sovereign issuers and issues, and central banks and their issues. The assignment of Fitch's sovereign ratings reflects a combination of our proprietary Sovereign Rating Model (SRM) and a Qualitative Overlay (QO).

Sovereign Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) and bond ratings are a forward-looking assessment of the capacity and willingness to honour debt obligations to private-sector creditors and public debt securities independent of ownership in full and on time. Sovereigns are assigned two IDRs: the Local-Currency (LC) IDR reflects the likelihood of default on debt issued (and payable) in the currency of the sovereign, while the Foreign-Currency (FC) IDR is an assessment of the credit risk associated with debt issued in foreign currencies.

## Key Rating Drivers

**Willingness and Capacity to Pay:** Fitch's approach to sovereign credit risk analysis is a synthesis of quantitative analysis and qualitative judgements that capture the willingness as well as the capacity of the sovereign to meet its debt obligations in full and on time. The activities and policy actions of the sovereign have a profound effect on and are also influenced by the performance of the country's economy as a whole, which in turn affects sovereign creditworthiness.

**Analytical Pillars:** Fitch's approach to sovereign rating analysis is an assessment of the following four analytical pillars, which inform the creditworthiness of the sovereign:

- Structural features of the economy that render it more or less vulnerable to shocks, including the risks posed by the financial sector, political risk and governance factors;
- Macroeconomic performance, policies and prospects, including growth prospects, economic stability and the coherence and credibility of policy;
- Public finances, including budget balances, the structure and sustainability of public debt and fiscal financing and the likelihood of the crystallisation of contingent liabilities;
- External finances, including the sustainability of current account balances and capital flows, and the level and structure of external debt (public and private).

**Weighting of Pillars:** Reflecting their importance to sovereign creditworthiness, structural features typically carry the highest weight within rating decision, as evidenced by their status as the highest-weighted pillar in the SRM. The weights of the other three pillars are typically lower, but this can vary, particularly in crisis situations.

**Sovereign Rating Model:** Fitch employs its SRM as the starting point for assigning sovereign ratings. The SRM replicates the principal elements of these rating criteria and generates a score calibrated to the Long-Term (LT) FC IDR scale. It is a multiple regression rating model rather than a probability of default model and employs historical, current and forward-looking data for 18 key variables.

**Qualitative Overlay:** Recognising that no quantitative model can fully capture all the relevant influences on sovereign creditworthiness, Fitch employs a forward-looking QO to adjust for factors not reflected or not fully reflected in the SRM output for any individual rating. The QO comprises a notch-adjustment system applied to the SRM output, with a potential notching range of +2/−2 for each of the four analytical pillars outlined above, and an overall notching adjustment range of +3/−3 for each rating, except in certain circumstances explained in these criteria.

## Country Risk Versus Sovereign Risk

Country risk and sovereign credit risk are related but distinct concepts. The former refers to the risks associated with doing business in a particular country, while sovereign credit ratings are more narrowly focused on the risk of a sovereign government defaulting on its debt obligations. Risks to doing business can include weak property rights, unpredictable tax and legal regimes, and a volatile operating environment.

A specific country risk that is especially pertinent for cross-border investment and lending is the risk of controls being imposed by the sovereign authorities on the conversion of local into foreign currency and on its transfer abroad to meet external debt service obligations. Transfer and convertibility (T&C) risk is explicitly addressed by the Country Ceiling that is assigned to all countries with Fitch-rated sovereign issuers (see Fitch's Country Ceilings Criteria).

Though there is a positive association between sovereign and broader country risk, the sovereign credit profile can improve without necessarily an improvement in the country risk profile. Similarly, deterioration in country risk conditions does not necessarily imply a worsening in sovereign creditworthiness, though often that will be the case.

## Country Risk Versus Sovereign Risk

Country risk and sovereign credit risk are related but distinct concepts. The former refers to the risks associated with doing business in a particular country, while sovereign credit ratings are more narrowly focused on the risk of a sovereign government defaulting on its debt obligations.

Risks to doing business can include:
- Weak property rights
- Unpredictable tax and legal regimes
- Volatile operating environment

A specific country risk that is especially pertinent for cross-border investment and lending is the risk of controls being imposed by the sovereign authorities on the conversion of local into foreign currency and on its transfer abroad to meet external debt service obligations. Transfer and convertibility (T&C) risk is explicitly addressed by the Country Ceiling that is assigned to all countries with Fitch-rated sovereign issuers (see Fitch's Country Ceilings Criteria).

Though there is a positive association between sovereign and broader country risk:
- The sovereign credit profile can improve without necessarily an improvement in the country risk profile
- Deterioration in country risk conditions does not necessarily imply a worsening in sovereign creditworthiness, though often that will be the case

### What Is a Sovereign?

From a rating perspective, a sovereign issuer is the government (usually national or federal) that de facto exercises primary fiscal authority over a recognised jurisdiction.

- Central banks, like other public-policy institutions, are agents of the sovereign
- Fitch typically rates central banks at the same level as the sovereign
- Securities issued by a Fitch-rated central bank will typically be rated at the same level as equivalent securities issued by the sovereign
- Central bank liabilities are typically not included in Fitch's calculation of government debt (see Public Finances section)
- If rated by Fitch, the IDR of the central bank would typically be aligned with the relevant sovereign IDR

Key considerations:
- Sovereigns have the highest authority and can enforce their will
- Creditors have limited legal recourse if a sovereign is unable or unwilling to service its debt
- Analysis of sovereign credit risk must consider both willingness to pay and financial capacity

---

## Sovereign Default Events

### Default Events

A sovereign's IDR will be lowered to 'RD' in case of:
- Missed coupon or principal repayment on a public debt security issued by the sovereign
- Missed payment on a public debt security with an unequivocal, irrevocable, and unconditional sovereign guarantee
- Failure to pay debt obligations (other than public debt securities) owed to private creditors by the sovereign
- Failure to pay debt obligations (other than public debt securities) owed to private creditors by third parties with a sovereign guarantee
- Execution of a distressed debt exchange (DDE)
- Forced redenomination of sovereign debt into a different currency (unless old currency ceased to exist)
- Unilateral or forced change of debt terms that constitutes a material reduction

---

### Traditional Payment Defaults

Process for rating downgrades:
1. When a sovereign announces intention to default or misses a payment during grace period:
   - Sovereign IDR downgraded to 'C'
   - Affected instruments downgraded to 'C'
2. If payment not made by end of grace period:
   - Sovereign IDR downgraded to 'RD'
   - Affected instruments downgraded to 'D'
   - Ratings for instruments with unexpired grace period may remain at 'C'
   - All affected instrument ratings typically withdrawn if not of market interest

Special considerations:
- Sovereigns may default selectively on instruments with same seniority and currency
- Non-defaulted securities could be rated higher than 'C' based on credit fundamentals
- Ratings based on Fitch's rating definitions

The sovereign IDR will be moved out of ‘RD’ when the default has been cured, either because
payment has been made, or a debt restructuring has been completed and Fitch judges the
sovereign to have normalised relations with a significant majority of creditors, even if there may
be some outstanding non-performing securities for example due to protracted legal or other
disputes.
In the event that Fitch becomes aware of a default event that is consistent with the above list
but that has already been cured, Fitch will record the event by placing the sovereign’s IDR to
‘RD’ before lifting the rating out of default to a level consistent with its current credit
fundamentals. This approach will apply only to events of default that have occurred during the
preceding three-year period, and that would have been considered as default events under
Fitch’s Sovereign Rating Criteria prevailing at the time the event occurred.
Distressed Debt Exchanges
A DDE is defined as an exchange offer to bondholders, consent solicitation, or a unilateral
exchange, debt moratorium or changes to an existing instrument initiated by the sovereign that
meets the following two conditions1:
1.
There is a material reduction in terms that could be one or a combination of the
following:
•Reduction in principal amount;
•Reduction in interest or fees;
•Extension of maturity date;
•Change in currency denomination of the debt;
•Change from a cash-pay basis to pay-in-kind (PIK), discount basis or other form
of non-cash payment;
•Exchange offers or cash tenders that are accepted only if the tendering
bondholder also consents to indenture amendments that materially impair the
position of holders that do not tender; or
Our presumption when any of the above is present is that there has been a material
reduction in terms, unless it can be clearly shown that creditors would be likely to be
indifferent between the old and new terms.
2.
The exchange is designed to avoid a traditional payment default. This is more likely for a
distressed issuer. This test is designed to understand whether investors face a genuine
choice between the proposed terms and the original contractual terms, or if failure of a
large part of the creditor group to accept the tender offer would call into doubt the
issuer’s ability to fulfil the original contractual terms.
In assessing whether a DDE has occurred, Fitch may also take into account whether eligible debt
instruments held by non-participants in the exchange will continue to be serviced in accordance
with the original terms. The assessment is designed to exclude situations in which sovereign
issuers seek to take advantage of market pricing developments, liquidity conditions or other
factors to engage in routine liability management. Fitch does not consider these situations as
DDEs.
A debt exchange that includes a rescheduling of all or a material proportion of a sovereign’s debt
obligations to both private and official-sector creditors can meet Fitch’s definition of a DDE
even in situations where the proportion of debt to private creditors is relatively modest, for
example because the official sector makes private sector participation a condition of a broader
restructuring.
If an announced intention to make an exchange offer is made that in Fitch’s opinion would
constitute a DDE, the sovereign’s IDR and the ratings of the securities subject to the exchange
will be lowered to ‘C’.
1
These principles can also be applied to the restructuring of bank loans extended to a sovereign borrower
or to secondary market operations, which will not involve an exchange offer.

Global
On closing of the exchange offer and following confirmation that the exchange will be executed
Fitch will place the IDR of the sovereign into ‘RD’. The ratings of the tendered securities will be
lowered to ‘D’ and will remain at that level for as long as the sovereign is rated ‘RD’. The ratings
of eligible securities that are not tendered and continue to be serviced will remain at ‘C’ until the
exchange is completed and then rated according to the new credit fundamentals of the
sovereign. Non-tendered, non-eligible securities will continue to be rated according to their
fundamentals during the DDE process.
Following completion of the DDE, the sovereign IDR will likely be lifted out of ‘RD’ to a rating
appropriate for its prospects on a forward-looking basis shortly after the effective date of the
exchange, although the IDR will likely be constrained to the low speculative-grade range.
However, if the securities not tendered in the exchange are non-performing, the ‘RD’ rating will
likely be maintained until the default is cured, such as through a further exchange, or until Fitch
judges the sovereign to have normalised relations with a significant majority of creditors
despite any outstanding non-performing securities.
When Fitch understands that a sovereign issuer plans to exchange several debt instruments
with a range of maturity dates for new debt securities as and when the existing obligations fall
due, Fitch will lower the sovereign’s IDR to ‘RD’ at the time the first of those instruments is
exchanged.
Members of Currency Unions and Dollarised Economies
Fitch will treat default by a sovereign issuer that is a member a monetary union on debt issued
in the currency of that union as a default on its LC IDR, while default on any other debt will be
treated as a default on its FC IDR. However, for fully dollarised economies, Fitch would treat
default on their dollarised debt as a default on the sovereign’s FC IDR.
Official Sector Debt
Although reported failure to repay debt, other than a public debt security, owed to the official
sector would not be judged a sovereign default event (reflecting the opacity of financial
relations between governments and the influence of political and non-financial factors), if
arrears to official creditors indicate growing financial distress and/or lack of willingness to pay,
the sovereign rating could be adversely affected. Moreover, official creditors may seek
comparable treatment for private-creditor claims as part of any restructuring of their own
claims, notably by the Paris Club of Official Creditors. Examples of official sector creditors
include the World Bank Group, the IMF, other international financial institutions (IFIs), bilateral
development agencies, export credit agencies and publicly owned development banks.
Debt Relief
Fitch generally views agreed debt relief from IFIs under multilateral initiatives to restore debt
sustainability as a positive development for sovereign creditworthiness and hence ratings over
the longer term. However, the need for such relief will initially exert a negative influence on
sovereign creditworthiness, and potentially on the rating, in the short-to-medium term as it will
be treated as a restructuring event within Fitch’s SRM.
Treatment of Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs in Default
The assignment by Fitch of a ‘RD’ rating on the ST FC IDR will also result in Fitch assigning a ‘RD’
rating to the LT FC IDR, irrespective of whether the sovereign has defaulted on any long-term
debt obligations. The same approach will apply in the event of Fitch assigning a ‘RD’ rating to the
sovereign’s ST LC IDR. This reflects the status of the LT IDR as being the benchmark rating for
recording default events within Fitch’s rating definitions.
Conversely, it will be possible for Fitch to assign an ‘RD’ rating to a sovereign’s LT FC or LC IDRs
without assigning a ‘RD’ rating to the ST FC or LC IDRs if no default has occurred on the
sovereign’s short-term debt obligations.

Sovereign Rating Model
Fitch employs its SRM as the starting point for assigning the agency’s sovereign ratings. The
SRM generates a score calibrated to the LT FC IDR scale between ‘AAA’ and ‘CCC+’. It is a rating
model rather than a probability of default model and incorporates a combination of historical,
current and forward-looking data.
Model Design and Derivation
The SRM has been estimated from the application of a multiple-regression Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS) to 18 economic and financial variables referenced in Appendix 1 for all Fitch-
rated sovereigns over a period from 2000 until the latest full year available, inclusive. The model
uses empirical data, allows for very limited judgemental analyst input (following the initial
calibration), and aims to provide a transparent, coherent framework for comparing sovereigns
across regions and through time. The OLS regression is re-estimated and reviewed annually to
incorporate additional data into the estimation period and to test for new potential variables,
ensuring that the SRM evolves in line with Fitch’s rating criteria.
The output of the OLS regression is a set of a coefficients and an intercept term2 that do not vary
by sovereign. These are applied to the data for an individual sovereign to determine the model
output.

Variables are included in the SRM based on their sovereign credit rationale, consistency of signs

variables, such as the current account and fiscal balances, to smooth the impact of volatility on
the output.CCC+

The 18 variables employed in the SRM are obtained from a range of sources, including the
sovereign issuer itself, BIS, the IMF and the World Bank. This data is updated for each rating
review and at least quarterly. The timeliness of availability of data can vary across substantially
between sovereigns (see Appendix 4: Data Sources, Limitations and Reasonable Investigation).
The SRM is structured using the four pillars of analysis outlined on the first page of this report.
The weights attributed to these pillars in the model, which are determined by the model itself
rather than by analytical intervention, and are subject to periodic review, are shown in the table
below. These weights are provided for illustrative purposes only.

There is no subjective judgement involved and they are not used to estimate coefficients or
when estimating the model output for a given sovereign. Rather, they are derived from
standardised coefficients, which are, in turn, derived from an exactly equivalent OLS regression
run on standardised data. Whilst the coefficients are used to calculate the SRM output, the
weights are provided as an ancillary item to aid interpretation. They indicate, intuitively, how
much of the variation in predicted ratings can be explained by variation in a given variable or
group of variables.
The coefficients and weights of the individual variables are referenced in the section for each
pillar. The intercept term is provided in Appendix1 3

See Appendix 1 for further information.
The SRM coefficients and intercept are presented to three decimal places in this document. However,
functionally, the SRM uses 15 significant figures (up to 20 decimal places).

Model Output and Application
The output of the SRM is a score that is calibrated to Fitch’s long-term rating scale and
corresponds linearly to a predicted LT FC IDR for the sovereign issuer (see SRM
Correspondence Table). Fitch’s sovereign analysts use the SRM output as the starting point in
the rating process, except in the cases described in Conditions and Exceptions to Application of
SRM and QO. The SRM incorporates a combination of historical, current and forward-looking
data (see Appendix 1).
Qualitative Overlay
As Fitch recognises that no quantitative model can fully capture all the relevant influences on
sovereign creditworthiness, the agency also employs a QO designed to adjust for factors that
are not reflected or not fully reflected in the SRM output for any individual rating. The QO is
used to provide a subjective assessment, consistent with the criteria, of key factors within these
rating criteria that are not able to be fully incorporated or reflected in the SRM. The QO is a
formalisation of the qualitative elements that Fitch applies in assessing sovereign
creditworthiness.
The QO is based partly on Fitch’s economic and financial projections, thereby complementing
the SRM, which includes a mix of historical and forward-looking data (one to two years of
forecasts as part of three-year centred averages for certain variables). The QO comprises a
rating adjustment system applied to the SRM output, with a potential notching range of +2/−2
for each of the four analytical pillars (structural features, macro, public finances and external
finances) and an overall rating adjustment range of +3/−3 for each rating, except in certain
circumstances as outlined below.
The rating committee decides on rating adjustments for each of the four analytical pillars – see
Qualitative Overlay Factors table in Appendix 1 – and explained further in the following
corresponding sections of these criteria. Additionally, and to illustrate, a QO rating adjustment
may be made to reflect any of the following, which is not an exhaustive list:
•Relevant factors/variables are not included in the SRM, because they are not
quantifiable, such as geopolitical risk; or because the variable could not be incorporated
into the SRM, for example because the variable is not available for all sovereigns or is not
statistically significant in the estimation period but is nevertheless believed to be
relevant.
•Data for certain variables are feeding into the SRM but there is uncertainty about the
data or there are data gaps. Adjustments for data gaps would typically be made in the
relevant analytical pillar. Adjustments for data are more likely to be negative, but in
certain cases could be positive.
•The SRM assumes a defined relationship, linear in most cases, between the variables and
the SRM output score but once variables move beyond a certain threshold the level of
vulnerability can increase at a greater pace than indicated by the SRM. A relevant
example of this phenomenon is the sovereign’s general government debt ratio, in which
increases in debt above certain levels can exert a greater negative impact on sovereign
creditworthiness than is reflected in the SRM.
•The values feeding into the SRM for a variable are different from the likely development
of the variable over the forecast horizon.
As a secondary consideration, any recommended notching takes account of the relative
qualities of the issuer compared with a peer group of issuers covering both the SRM output
category and the rating category (if the two are different). Although the notching range for each
of the four pillars allows for +2/−2 notches to be applied, the overall maximum adjustment
relative to the SRM output is capped at +3/−3, meaning that the maximum notching
adjustments for each of the pillars cannot be applied simultaneously.
In certain circumstances, Fitch’s sovereign rating committee may extend the range of overall
notching to address the inability of the SRM to adjust rapidly to or deal with such circumstances.

These circumstances could include, but are not limited to:
•a country in a crisis situation, which could include a severe recession, banking sector
crisis, constrained ability to access market financing, or recourse to external official
sector financing;
•a country recovering from a crisis (as defined above);
•a country that has defaulted and been assigned an IDR of ‘D’ or ‘RD’ within the past five
years;
•a country that has been downgraded by at least one rating category (i.e. three notches)
within the past five years; and
•a country displaying signs of vulnerability to future shocks.
Conditions and Exceptions to Application of SRM and QO
The application of the QO will be subject to the following conditions and exceptions:
•‘CCC+’ and Below: For any sovereign issuer where the proposed LT FC IDR is ‘CCC+’ or
below, or when the sovereign rating committee decides to assign a rating of ‘CCC+’ or
below, the committee will not utilise the SRM and QO to explain the rating as it will
instead be directly based on Fitch’s rating definitions for the ‘CCC+’ and below rating
levels. LT FC IDRs that are rated ‘CCC+’ or below can be upgraded to the ‘B’ category or
above if the sovereign rating committee decides that the definitions for ratings of ‘CCC+’
and below are no longer appropriate for the issuer in question. In this situation, the
combination of the SRM and QO will be re-adopted to determine the LT FC IDR of the
issuer. In situations when the SRM output is ‘CCC+’ but the committee decides that
upward notching using the QO is justified, the application of the QO will be consistent
with the guidance outlined above, notching up from a starting point of ‘CCC+’ to
determine the LT FC IDR. Fitch’s rating definitions incorporate the +/- modifiers at all
rating levels from ‘AA’ to ‘CCC’ inclusive.
•Temporary Migration: Additionally, in situations when the SRM output migrates from
one rating notch to another – either up or down – but the migration results in the SRM
score moving into a different rating notch level by a marginal amount, the committee can
decide not to adopt the new SRM output as the starting point on which to apply the QO
if it is deemed likely to be a temporary deterioration or improvement. Typically, the
period for such a temporary deviation from the SRM output will be limited to a maximum
of two years, although the rating committee can extend this period at its judgement.
•SRM Re-estimation: This ability for the sovereign rating committee not to adopt the
SRM output as the starting point on which to apply the QO also extends to situations
when a change in the output is caused by a re-estimation of the SRM, a process that Fitch
undertakes on at least an annual basis. The ability not to adopt the SRM output as the
starting point would typically be invoked when the change in a country’s SRM score is
marginal and when it is not clear that the credit fundamentals of the country have
changed materially, notwithstanding the re-estimation of the SRM.
•Data Revisions and Limitations: In situations when sovereigns issue revisions to existing
published data, these will be reflected in updated historical and projected variables in
the SRM, and the potential impact on the rating, if any, will be considered at the next
rating review following a full analysis of the implications of the revision by the analytical
team.
Additionally, in the event of data limitations that are potentially material to the rating
outcome, Fitch will consider making an adjustment in the QO within the relevant
analytical pillar, e.g. if there is a lack of information on external assets and liabilities, a
negative notching adjustment could be made to the External Finances section of the QO.
If Fitch believes that this lack of information is so significant as to render any analysis
insufficiently robust to support a rating or rating action, Fitch will not assign a rating, or
will withdraw an existing rating.

The table in Appendix 1 summarises the factors that Fitch considers to determine the level of
notching in the QO. In each of the analytical pillars, the qualitative judgements reflect primarily
factors not already captured in the SRM. As a secondary consideration, any recommended
notching takes account of the relative qualities of the issuer compared with a peer group of

The credit rationale for the inclusion of the above variables in the SRM is as follows:
•
Governance indicators – Governance indicators are included to capture the capacity
and willingness of the authorities to mobilise resources to fund debt payments and the
risk that this might be disrupted by civil unrest, political instability or conflict, as well as
the effectiveness of government and institutions in managing economic activity and
absorbing adverse shocks. Therefore, they are also a proxy for many intangible and
difficult-to-measure factors that enhance debt tolerance. The composite governance
indicator is the simple average of a sovereign’s percentile ranks for the six World Bank
Worldwide Governance Indicators: “Rule of Law”; “Control of Corruption”;
“Government Effectiveness”, “Voice and Accountability”, “Regulatory Quality” and
“Political Stability and Absence of Violence”. Each of the World Bank governance
indicators is a statistical aggregation of perceptions of various aspects of governance
from a range of public- and private-sector sources. Fitch uses the World Bank indicators
in the criteria because of their comprehensiveness, methodological transparency,
widespread use in other cross-country studies, and completeness of coverage
geographically and over time.

•
GDP per capita – High income per head implies that labour is engaged in high-value-
added activities (though this is not necessarily the case for commodity producers) and
hence that the economy is less vulnerable and better able to absorb adverse shocks.
Fitch uses GDP per head both as a measure of income and as a proxy for the stock and
quality of labour and capital and financial wealth and an indicator of overall
development. This variable is calculated as the percentile rank of per capita GDP in US
dollars at market exchange rates across all Fitch-rated sovereigns, such as that the Fitch-
rated sovereign with the highest GDP per capita scores 100. A sovereign with a
percentile rank of 2.5 would indicate that 97.5% of all Fitch-rated sovereigns have a
higher per-capita income than that given sovereign.
The rationale for using percentile ranks is to eliminate the impact on the SRM output of
the positive trend in nominal per-capita income over the medium term for most
countries. A market exchange rate estimate of per-capita income is preferred to a
purchasing power parity (PPP) estimate because of the time lag in the availability of PPP-
based estimates, possible errors in estimates of PPP and the difficulty of forecasting PPP
per-capita income.
•
Share in world GDP – This variable captures the relatively high vulnerability of small
economies. For each country in each year, it is calculated as the natural logarithm of the
share of the country’s GDP in world GDP, measured in US dollar terms at market
exchange rates. The rationale for this variable is primarily to incorporate the impact on
the rating of exposure to shocks beyond those likely to be captured by the GDP volatility
variable. The smaller a country, the higher the potential impact of an idiosyncratic
natural disaster or severe exogenous shock on its economy and the less domestic
economic agents, including the public sector, are able to hedge against such shocks.
Typically, smaller economies are also less diversified, increasing the impact from sector-
specific shocks, either domestic or exogenous in origin.
For smaller economies, the low liquidity of their debt instruments can be a barrier to
entering international markets and can increase the cost of cross-border risk
diversification. Share in world GDP is measured in logarithms because of the non-
linearity of the size effect: small countries are vulnerable, but the marginal benefit of
being larger declines rapidly.
•
Years since default or restructuring event – All else being equal, a recent episode of
sovereign debt restructuring (which could include either default or non-default events)
generally reveals weaknesses in a country’s policy framework that allowed fiscal,
economic or political conditions to develop along a trajectory culminating in the
restructuring; such an event can sometimes also be a signal of a sovereign’s lack of
willingness to pay, which is otherwise difficult to measure directly. However, the
influence on the rating of even recent episodes of restructuring can be moderated by
qualitative factors in the QO (see below). Generally, series of official-sector
restructurings will be treated in the model as a single reset event, with the reset day
typically occurring at the time of the initial restructuring.
Types of restructuring events that typically have been captured within this variable
include any sovereign default event under these criteria (see Sovereign Default Events),
including where we have adequate information to assess with reasonable confidence the
occurrence of such an event prior to our rating coverage, international debt relief
programmes including the Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative, those
administered by the G20, and Paris Club restructurings. Certain situations that appear
to fulfil the criteria of a restructuring event may not be captured in this variable. For
example, when a sovereign bilateral lender agrees to a mutually acceptable
restructuring of a debt obligation owed by another sovereign (e.g. extending maturities
on bilateral loans that form part of a broader trade and investment relationship) and
Fitch does not assess this to be a DDE as outlined in these criteria, such an event would
not be regarded as a restructuring event for the purposes of this variable.
The SRM variable is a non-linear function of time since the event. It is one in the year of
the event and zero if there has been no event after 1980. In the year of the event,
proximity of default/restructuring deducts about 1.8 notches from the model output; for

each year that elapses since the event, its impact on the rating declines exponentially
such that it halves in about 4.3 years.
•
Broad money supply – The ratio of broad money to GDP is used as a proxy for the level
of financial intermediation in the economy. The richer the country (measured in terms of
monetary assets available in an economy), the higher the level of public debt that the
economy can tolerate. In testing, the best specification of this variable in the model was
in terms of natural logarithms, suggesting a non-linear relationship between money
supply and creditworthiness.
QO Rationale
QO factors – relative to SRM data and output
•Political stability and capacity, including the level of political risk, the risk of fundamental regime
change and/or military conflict, broader geopolitical risks, the ability of the political system to address
economic and fiscal challenges and willingness to pay.
•Financial sector risks reflecting Fitch’s assessment of the health of the banking system and the level
of macro-prudential risks in the economy, as measured by Fitch’s BSI and MPI rankings, as well as
other relevant considerations.
•Other structural factors including the quality of the business environment and economic flexibility
reflected in, among other factors, the ability to attract investment, the level of domestic savings,
openness to international flows and the ability to respond to shocks. It will also be possible to reflect
here items such as unrepresentative levels of GDP and similar issues that can affect the Structural
Features variables in the SRM.
Source: Fitch Ratings
The rationale for the inclusion of these QO factors is as follows:
•
Political stability and capacity – Political and geopolitical risks can have an important
bearing on sovereign creditworthiness. A high degree of consensus on major social and
economic issues is associated with stable and predictable economic policies. Conversely,
in a country that is riven by divisions along the lines of income distribution, race, religion
or regional differences, the government of the day may encounter numerous challenges
to its authority and undermine its ability to conduct effective economic and financial
policies. Account is also taken of powerful vested interests that may block essential
structural reforms.
-Geopolitical risks, meanwhile, can take many forms, including conflicts or
tensions in neighbouring countries, the imposition of economic sanctions,
security threats or actual occurrences and broader supranational relationships.
To the extent they are relevant for an individual sovereign issuer, these factors
could be reflected in notching in this area of the QO.
-While political risk is to some extent reflected in the quantitative variables
included in the SRM (notably under “Political stability and the absence of
violence” in the World Bank Worldwide Governance Indicators), there are
broader political risk factors that could affect sovereign creditworthiness. These
would include risks that the sovereign authorities will lack the political capacity
and will to address economic and fiscal challenges or to mobilise resources
necessary to honour their financial obligations. There might also be cases when
recent political events are not yet captured in the World Bank Worldwide
Governance Indicators but are judged to exert a material impact on
creditworthiness.
-On occasion, the advent or aftermath of elections or other intense political
pressures can lead to a marked detrimental shift in economic policy, such as a
loosening in fiscal policy ahead of elections, or a change in the policy framework
if a populist government comes to power, or policy paralysis in the event of an
inconclusive election result.

•
-Other political risks relating to sovereign debt service that may need to be
reflected by QO adjustments within this pillar include parliamentary or
congressional approval or similar processes that may be needed to enable a
sovereign government to issue new debt. In the event that such approval is not
forthcoming, downward QO notching in this pillar may be appropriate to reflect
increased risks to sovereign debt service.
-In relation to the “Years since default or restructuring event” SRM variable, the
influence on the rating of even recent episodes of default/restructuring will be
greatly moderated if Fitch judges that the event is not symptomatic of a
continuing weakness in the political capacity and will of the sovereign authorities
to mobilise resources to honour debt obligations. Conversely, while the SRM
does factor in an impact from default/restructuring events in this way, in certain
circumstances Fitch could also make an adjustment in the QO that goes beyond
the standard +/−3 notch adjustment range to reflect a relatively recent event,
particularly if the agency views the event as indicative of weakness in the
capacity and/or willingness of the sovereign to honour its debt obligations.
Financial sector risks – There are two principal risks posed to sovereign
creditworthiness by the country’s domestic financial sector: macroeconomic instability
and contingent liability. Recapitalisation of financial systems has historically resulted in
significant increases in the government’s debt burden; this risk is typically captured in
the Structural Features pillar, but the ultimate impact when it materialises is likely to be
reflected in the sovereign’s public finances pillar. The risks to macroeconomic stability
arise from a weak financial system that amplifies rather than absorbs shocks to the
economy, for example by exacerbating exchange rate over-shooting in response to an
external shock due to (explicit or implicit) currency mismatches on its balance sheet. The
failure of a single large entity can also result in a collapse in confidence in the system as
a whole, prompting deposit and capital flight and disrupting the ability of the sovereign
to finance itself in domestic and international financial markets.
-BSI measures system strength – An important starting point for the analysis of
banking system risk in the context of these criteria is Fitch’s Bank Systemic Risk
(BSR) indicators, which are updated and published at least annually. One of the
BSR measures is the Banking System Indicator (BSI), which aims to measure a
banking system’s standalone financial quality or strength and is a simple
weighted average of bank Viability Ratings for a critical mass of a country’s
banks. The typical developed-country banking system is scored ‘a’, whereas the
typical EM system is in the range ‘bbb’/‘bb’/‘b’. Financially weak systems with
substantial liabilities (eg indicated by a high ratio of private credit to GDP) could
imply large contingent liabilities for the sovereign and hence will be a negative
rating factor. Conversely, financially strong bank systems that do not represent
a material contingent liability and are efficient in attracting and allocating savings
to investment projects represent a positive rating factor. In the event that the BSI
score is a rating category or more below the Sovereign LT FC IDR, the rating
committee will consider whether downward notching should be applied in the
QO.
-Intervention can impair sovereign creditworthiness – Sovereign intervention in the
banking system typically occurs through supervision and regulation, but can also
take the form of financial support, including the “socialisation” of bank liabilities
so as to ensure the solvency of the system, although recent developments in the
context of bank resolution regulations have reduced the propensity of
sovereigns to provide direct financial support. The capacity of the sovereign to
intervene in support of the banking sector without materially impairing its own
creditworthiness is a function of the credibility and capacity of the central bank
as a lender of last resort and the capacity of the government to absorb domestic
banking and financial-sector liabilities without threatening its own solvency and
financing capacity.

•
-Foreign ownership typically positive – Other indicators of financial system
soundness reviewed in the sovereign rating analysis include the ratio of non-
performing to total loans, capital adequacy ratio (based on Basel definition when
available) and relative shares of public and foreign ownership. Qualitative
judgements are also made in conjunction with Fitch’s Financial Institutions
Group on the effectiveness of supervision and regulation. Fitch takes some
comfort from high levels of foreign ownership, which is often associated with the
transfer of more sophisticated financial management and technology that
reduces the risk of bank failure; also, the foreign parent rather than the sovereign
is the principal source of finance in the event of distress. In contrast, publicly
owned banks have historically been subject to political interference and engaged
in quasi-fiscal operations that have undermined financial soundness and often
required substantial fiscal resources to resolve.
-MPI ranking – The other BSR measure is the Macro-Prudential Indicator (MPI),
which ranges from ‘3’ – high potential vulnerability to financial stress over the
medium term based on trends in credit expansion, equity and property prices and
real exchange rates – to ‘1’ – low likelihood (see Appendix 3: Macro-Prudential
Indicator Model). This indicator can provide an early-warning signal of potential
financial distress that, in the most adverse circumstances, could result in
macroeconomic instability and/or large contingent liabilities being realised by
the sovereign. The MPI measures the extent to which these indicators have
increased over a given time period and the potential level of overvaluation that
could lead to financial instability in the economy and liabilities for the sovereign.
When the MPI score is ‘2’ or ‘3’, indicating a relatively higher likelihood of
vulnerability to potential stress, a downward notching adjustment may be
applied in the QO. An MPI score of ‘1’ in itself typically does not warrant a
positive notching adjustment.
Other Structural Factors – This includes the quality of the business environment, the
quality of human capital, the ability to attract investment, the level of domestic savings,
openness to international flows and the ability to respond to shocks. Fitch uses the UN’s
Human Development Index to determine the quality of human capital. The quality of the
business environment can be important in influencing the level of investment in the
economy, both domestic and foreign, which is typically a prerequisite for sustainable
economic growth. Fitch uses a range of sources to assess the quality of the business
environment. It will also be possible to reflect here items such as unrepresentative levels
of GDP and similar issues that can affect the Structural Features variables in the SRM.
Countries where GDP data are unrepresentative of the economy’s underlying
fundamentals may consequently benefit disproportionately in the SRM score; an
appropriate adjustment can be reflected here.

10.1
Source: Fitch Ratings
The credit rationale for the inclusion of the above variables in the SRM is as follows:
•Real GDP growth volatility – Macroeconomic volatility constrains savings and
investment, distorts the development of the financial sector, and hinders long-term
business decision-making. It also adversely affects the capacity of the sovereign (as well
as the broader public and private sectors) to tolerate a given level of indebtedness.
Protracted periods of economic instability render the economy and public finances
much more vulnerable to shocks and hence prone to interruptions in sovereign debt
service. An exponentially weighted standard deviation of historical annual percent
changes in real GDP is used by Fitch to assess GDP growth volatility, such that the most
recent annual percent change accounts for 15% of the volatility calculation. This means,
for example, that the most recent 10 years’ data account for 80% of volatility calculation
and the most recent 20 years account for 96% of volatility calculation.
•Consumer price inflation – Sovereigns underpinned by economies that have benefited
from a record of low inflation and stable economic growth will tend to be rated more
highly than those that have (or have experienced in the recent past) chronic high
inflation and severe economic cycles. The legacy of previous episodes of high and volatile
inflation can persist for several years. The longer the period that low-to-moderate
inflation is sustained, the greater the confidence that it will remain so. Economies with a
long history of high inflation often exhibit high degrees of indexation and dollarisation,
as foreign currency becomes the chief store of value and the exchange rate the key
reference price for the economy. The SRM specification for this variable has been
adjusted to reduce the positive influence of persistently low inflation, which – in Fitch’s
view – is not necessarily positive for sovereign creditworthiness. The updated inflation
variable has been set to a minimum of 2% and a maximum of 50% (the latter to reflect a
threshold for hyper-inflation).
•Real GDP growth – Economies with sustained high rates of economic growth are
typically better able to absorb adverse shocks, and the volatility of public finances is
correspondingly lower. In addition, the maintenance of consistent strong growth rates
over an extended time period will eventually lead to a country’s average income and
wealth levels increasing towards those of higher rated peers, thereby enhancing
creditworthiness (see Structural Features).

QO Rationale
QO factors – relative to SRM data and output
•Macroeconomic policy credibility and flexibility, including coherence and robustness in terms of
consistency, flexibility and credibility of monetary and fiscal policies.
•GDP growth outlook over the medium term relative to peers.
•Macroeconomic stability reflected in, among other factors, the level of imbalances, unemployment
levels and trends, and contributions to growth of different sectors of the economy.
Source: Fitch Ratings
The rationale for the inclusion of these QO factors is as follows:
•
Macroeconomic policy credibility and flexibility – Fitch considers a credible policy
framework to be one in which responsible monetary and fiscal policies work in tandem
towards a sustainable long-term growth path while minimising the impact on output and
inflation of adverse economic shocks. Countries that have benefited from a long period
of sound macroeconomic policies are likely, other things being equal, to enjoy stable and
higher non-inflationary growth, leading to higher income levels and greater resilience to
shocks.
-Fixed or pegged exchange rates can increase vulnerability – Sovereign debt crises
have often been preceded by a currency collapse and financial crisis due to
inappropriate exchange-rate policies that have failed to adjust to shocks and/or
are inconsistent with other economic policies, and in particular fiscal policy.
Although a fixed exchange-rate regime may be the optimal arrangement for
countries with certain characteristics, the experience of economic and sovereign
debt crises since the mid-1990s suggests that fixed and in particular pegged
exchange-rate regimes can be especially damaging to the economy and sovereign
creditworthiness if they fail. Consequently, in the rating analysis of sovereigns
that operate fixed or managed exchange-rate regimes, particular attention is
given to the consistency and sustainability of the macroeconomic policy
framework, as well as to the robustness of the financial sector, balance-of-
payments trends and the level of international reserves and other foreign assets
relative to liquid foreign-currency and external liabilities.
-Foreign demand for domestic assets increases policy flexibility – The greater the
depth of demand for sovereign and local-currency assets, the greater the
flexibility of monetary and fiscal policies in responding to adverse shocks.
Shallow demand for local-currency assets is typically reflected by a high degree
of dollarisation, low level of financial intermediation (measured by the ratio of
private credit to GDP) and under-developed domestic capital markets. The less
price-elastic the demand for local-currency assets, the weaker the capacity of the
central bank to act as a credible lender of last resort to the financial sector, while
the government has less scope to incur and fund large budget deficits. Countries
with currencies that exhibit reserve-currency characteristics enjoy exceptionally
strong financial and policy flexibility.
-Fiscal policy key in monetary unions – Monetary and exchange-rate policies figure
less prominently in sovereign assessments of countries in a currency union, such
as the eurozone, or that are fully dollarised (in contrast to economies that are
partially dollarised and still have a local currency). In these instances when
monetary and exchange-rate policies are not under the direct control of the
sovereign authorities, greater emphasis is placed on appropriate fiscal and
structural adjustment policies and the competitiveness and flexibility of the
economy.

Sovereigns
Global
-Dollarised economies limit monetary policy – A large stock of foreign-currency
deposits in a banking system can quickly become a drain on the system’s foreign
assets (including central bank international reserves) and a source of capital
flight. The ratio of foreign currency to total deposits – the dollarisation ratio – is
one of the relative factors within this pillar. Dollarisation and indexation of
contracts (debt as well as wages) limit the capacity of monetary and exchange
rate policies to contain and manage shocks, while also reducing the scope to
monetise local-currency sovereign debt obligations while containing inflationary
pressures.
-Macro data outturns may mask weakness – While the quality of the policy
framework will to some extent be reflected in the quantitative variables included
in the SRM, any recent changes in policy direction will take time to be observed
in the data out-turns. Also, stronger or weaker policy frameworks may not
translate into materially divergent economic performance until a crisis occurs,
but Fitch believes that it is important to factor such differences into its sovereign
ratings throughout the cycle.
•GDP growth outlook – Although the SRM GDP growth variable captures an element of
forward-looking analysis by incorporating one year of projections within the three-year
centred average calculation, it does not take account of the medium-term growth
outlook for the economy, which is relevant for macroeconomic performance and also for
the future trajectory of public finances. In assessing this factor in the QO, Fitch typically
focuses on the five-year outlook for GDP growth relative to both the issuer’s past
performance and rating category peers.
•Macroeconomic stability – The SRM variables do not include any specific quantitative
measures of certain macroeconomic factors, such as unemployment levels or
developments in sectors of the economy such as real estate that have a propensity for
generating instability. While GDP volatility and inflation could provide evidence of
macroeconomic imbalances or instability, Fitch will analyse other potential sources of
instability as part of this qualitative assessment, including a forward-looking view on
whether such imbalances could affect the sovereign’s credit profile.

Source: Fitch Ratings
The credit rationale for the inclusion of the above variables in the SRM is as follows:
•Gross general government debt to GDP – A heavy government debt burden will, other
things being equal, be associated with a higher risk of default. However, the level at
which the public debt burden ceases to be sustainable varies across countries and over
time, and hence there is no simple linear relationship between the stock of government
debt relative to GDP on one side and sovereign creditworthiness and ratings on the
other. This reflects the reality that more highly rated countries with developed capital
markets usually have higher debt capacity than countries with more limited financing
options. Debt tolerance is therefore also typically higher for developed-economy
countries at higher rating levels than for less developed countries.
•The principal measure of sovereign indebtedness that Fitch has adopted is gross general
government debt relative to GDP. In Fitch’s opinion, gross government debt is the most
relevant and comprehensive measure of sovereign indebtedness and the one that best
lends itself to cross-sovereign comparative analysis. The general government’s net debt
position (gross general government debt less its deposits with financial institutions) is
also an important indicator of indebtedness and can be more closely aligned with the
government’s ongoing budgetary financing and liquidity needs.
For a number of sovereigns, general government data are not available or are only
published with long time lags. In those cases, Fitch may decide to use central government
data if it believes that the central government data are a sufficiently close proxy to the
general government. This applies to all public finance variables in the SRM.

•General government interest payments to government revenue – The cost of servicing
government debt (expressed as a percentage of revenues) is an important consideration
in the context of the public finances. The cost of borrowing is one of the key variables
assessed and projected as part of Fitch’s debt sustainability analysis and helps to
determine the future trajectory of government debt. High and/or rising interest burdens
erode sovereign solvency and limit the sovereign’s flexibility in the management of
public finances, potentially constraining its ability to implement counter-cyclical fiscal
policy to provide stimulus during periods of macroeconomic weakness.
•General government fiscal balance to GDP – The general government fiscal balance
reflects the net balance of revenues accrued and expenditures incurred on an annual
basis. Typically, sustained high fiscal deficits (as a percentage of GDP) will tend to be
indicative of loose fiscal policy management and, other things being equal, are likely to
lead to rising indebtedness.
•Foreign-currency government debt to total government debt – Foreign-currency-
denominated (or indexed) debt, expressed as a percentage of gross general government
debt, can be thought of as capturing what is known as “original sin” – the limited ability
of the government to borrow at longer maturities in its own currency. This issue is also
related to reserve-currency flexibility (see External Finances section): governments
located in large and sophisticated economies with a history of relative macroeconomic
(and especially price) stability can typically raise funds predominantly in their own
currency, at home as well as abroad. For fully dollarised economies, this ratio is always
set at 100%.
Governments that borrow substantially in foreign currency create currency risk on their
balance sheets as revenues (usually from domestic taxes) are typically denominated in
local currency. In the event of a devaluation or depreciation of the local currency, a
sovereign will typically see its foreign-currency-denominated debt increase as a share of
GDP and revenues. Furthermore, this currency risk can materialise at – and exacerbate
– times of economic and financial stress as this is often when devaluations occur. The
presence of “original sin” can even precipitate or accelerate crises or stress if lenders
fearing future problems become reluctant to roll over debt. In addition, sovereign
borrowers in foreign currency are usually more reliant on foreign investors, who may be
a less stable source of funding than domestic investors with a “home bias”, and therefore
are more vulnerable to sudden stops in capital flows. In contrast, reserve-currency
flexibility confers huge advantages in terms of fiscal and monetary policy flexibility.
QO Rationale
QO factors – relative to SRM data and output
•Fiscal financing flexibility, including the record of market access, ability to issue at sustainable yields
and long maturities in domestic currency, the depth of local capital markets, access to other potential
sources of financing (eg multilateral), expected ability to issue in a stress scenario, presence of large
sovereign deposits or other resources.
•Public debt sustainability, including projected peak and trajectory of debt dynamics, taking into
consideration the credibility of the fiscal framework, the cost of financing (including access to
concessional funding) and ageing-related pressure on the primary balance, sovereign assets, and the
extent and nature of contingent liabilities that could crystallise on the sovereign balance sheet.
•Fiscal structure, focusing on the breadth of the revenue base, the concentration/diversification of
revenue sources and the level of budgetary rigidity in terms of current spending.

The rationale for the inclusion of these QO factors is as follows:
•
Fiscal financing flexibility
-
Market access record and ability to issue in a stress scenario – The ability of a
sovereign issuer to retain market access and to fund itself at sustainable yields is
an important consideration, especially during periods of market stress or
dislocation. This means that the analysis of a sovereign’s public finances becomes
materially more important during periods of market dislocation. Sovereigns that

have lost market access in previous periods of stress may be subject to a negative
notching adjustment in the QO, although such lost market access could alternatively
be reflected in an adjustment in the External Finances section of the QO to reflect a
broader loss of external market access than just the Sovereign. In those
circumstances, only one adjustment would be made to avoid double-counting.
-
Debt structure and depth of capital markets – Fitch examines the maturity, interest
rate and currency composition of government debt, which informs its judgement
on the extent of market-based risk faced by the government. A sovereign can
gain additional financing flexibility and an ability to sustain relatively high levels
of debt if it has a well-regulated, liquid domestic government debt market that is
underpinned by a broad range of investors (local institutional investors such as
pension and other savings funds), willing and able to provide a range of financing
alternatives (including long-maturity and fixed-rate funding), and is resilient to
all but extreme economic and political shocks. A government debt stock that is
characterised by long maturity and duration materially reduces refinancing and
interest rate risks. Similarly, extensive hedging of foreign exchange and interest
rate exposures in relation to a sovereign’s debt structure can mitigate these risks.
Conversely, a prevalence of short-term or unhedged debt renders the
government balance sheet much more vulnerable to market-based risk.
The availability of concessional financing (see Relationships with official sector
creditors below) would also be considered in the context of our debt structure
analysis.
-Sovereign deposits and other fiscal assets – Fitch also takes into account the
government’s liquid financial assets, such as unencumbered deposits, which
could be drawn down to finance its budget deficit in the event of difficult market
access. When assets are material and Fitch is able to establish that they are liquid,
unencumbered and can be used to refinance or repay government debt, their
presence can result in positive QO notching.
-Relationships with official sector creditors – Relations with the international
community, including with IFIs (i.e. the IMF and development banks) and major
global or regional powers, may also influence the assessment of financing
flexibility. Unwillingness for political or other reasons to secure policy-
conditional financing from the IMF and other IFIs reduces the sovereign’s
financing options in a distress scenario.
Conversely, a well-designed, credible and internationally funded economic
programme can stabilise local financial markets, normalise the flow of private
capital, and lay the basis for sustained recovery. Nonetheless, emergency
financial support from the IFIs is a sign of distress, and it is likely that the
sovereign credit profile and rating will have deteriorated over the months
preceding receipt of external assistance.
•
Public debt sustainability
-Public Debt Trajectory – The sustainability of a given level of government debt is
also a function of direction. When debt levels are rising significantly, particularly
if there is weak credibility that fiscal policies will be sufficient to adjust the
primary budget balance (i.e. the budget balance excluding net interest payments)
to establish and sustain the debt ratio on a downward path over the medium to
long term, the SRM variable for the current level of general government
debt/GDP may not fully capture the risks to long-run solvency of the
government.
-Non-Linearities Associated with High Debt - On occasion, a very high level of
government debt/GDP may warrant a negative adjustment in the QO if, for
example, it is judged that the SRM does not capture sufficiently the non-linearity
associated with risks surrounding a modest increase in the debt ratio that could
be better tolerated if the debt level were lower.

Fitch’s proprietary Debt Dynamics Model (DDM) is usually employed to assist
the rating committee in judging the sustainability of a given debt level and
current fiscal policy settings. The DDM output is a projection for government
debt/GDP typically across a five-year horizon. This is based on assumptions, also
across a five-year horizon, for the input variables – general government primary
balance, general government interest payments, GDP deflator, real GDP growth,
the exchange rate and stock flow adjustments. Fitch may extend DDM
projections beyond five years when considered relevant for the rating
assessment.
Several alternative projections for government debt/GDP are produced when
running the DDM, based on alternative sets of input assumptions. This provides
sensitivity analysis of the output with respect to shocks (such as fiscal slippage,
increase in the cost of borrowing, economic recession or currency depreciation)
in the input variables, relative to the baseline assumptions.
In determining whether to apply a QO adjustment, the rating committee will
consider the trajectory of general government debt/GDP according to baseline
input assumptions (for example, summarised by the peak and the overall
percentage point change in general government debt/GDP over the projection
period), the likelihood of this outcome, the results of the sensitivity analysis and
the government’s record on fiscal policy.
Fitch does not employ its DDM for countries with negligible or zero public debt
burdens, as it would not produce any meaningful output on which to base its
analysis of the public finances. Additionally, Fitch may decide not to employ its
DDM for sovereign issuers in distress situations when the medium-term
trajectory of the debt profile is less relevant than near-term financing and
repayment capacity considerations.
-Government assets – Fitch will take into account the sovereign’s financial assets,
such as deposits or portfolio investments in sovereign wealth funds, to the extent
that its net debt and overall solvency position is materially stronger than
indicated by its gross debt position (which feeds into the SRM). Fitch does not
typically consider illiquid assets, including government stakes in state-owned
enterprises, as potentially sources of liquidity for debt service in the near term
even if they are large, as they tend to be difficult to liquidate in a crisis scenario.
However, in some cases they can be liquidated over time to support solvency and
debt sustainability.
-Size and potential crystallisation of contingent liabilities – Contingent liabilities for
the government are myriad, ranging from explicit guarantees on other entities’ debt
to future liabilities arising from unfunded pension commitments and potential
support for the domestic banking sector or the private sector more generally.
Analysis of contingent liabilities is hampered by a lack of comprehensive and
consistent data across countries. In assessing the extent to which contingent
liabilities affect the sovereign’s creditworthiness, Fitch takes into account both the
size of the explicit and (when measurable) implicit contingent liabilities and the
likelihood of them crystallising on the sovereign’s balance sheet. If the materialization
risk of financial sector contingent labilities is already captured in the QO of the
Structural Features pillar, it may not need to be captured here.
In Fitch’s view, debt measures that include the liabilities of the broader public
sector, such as state-owned or controlled entities, can obscure the underlying
state of government finances and the analysis of any fiscal adjustment that may
be required to underpin confidence in the long-term solvency of the sovereign.
Consequently, Fitch does generally not assess the debt obligations of state-
owned enterprises as sovereign debt liabilities for the purpose of calculating the
sovereign’s gross general government debt stock, even though their credit
profile may be closely linked to that of the sovereign.

That said, Fitch may include the financial liabilities of a public-sector entity as
part of government debt if there is an explicit and full guarantee from the
government for those liabilities and Fitch judges that the guarantee is almost
certain to be called, but these situations are likely to be extremely rare.
Fitch will also take account of the potential adverse impact on budget deficits and
debt levels from adverse demographic trends such as an ageing population and
rising old age dependency ratio (population 65 years and older relative to those
of working age). Fitch will reflect demographic pressures in ratings as a product
of their proximity and severity, taking account of the likelihood of reforms to
mitigate their effects.
Fitch also takes into account other sovereign financial obligations, which in some
cases can include obligations under public-private partnerships (eg guarantee or
grantor payments), but these would typically only be included in our sovereign
debt ratio calculations when there is a clear legal obligation and they are deemed
likely to crystallise.
•
Fiscal structure – The degree of budgetary rigidity is also a factor that influences Fitch’s
analysis of the vulnerability of public finances to shocks, as well as the sustainability of a
given debt burden. This analysis focuses on the breadth of the revenue base, the
concentration/diversification of revenue sources, and the level of budgetary rigidity in
terms of current spending.

Only for countries without RCF
Source: Fitch Ratings
The credit rationale for the inclusion of the above variables in the SRM is as follows:
•Reserve-currency flexibility – The variable for RCF captures the reality that countries
whose currencies have a significant role in global official foreign-exchange reserve
portfolios are less likely to experience funding stress, reflecting stable demand for assets
denominated in their currency. For countries (such as the US) with exceptionally strong
reserve-currency flexibility, these assets tend to be a destination for safe-haven capital
flows in times of market stress. RCF benefits fiscal as well as external financing flexibility
as the majority of reserve assets are government bonds and RCF therefore tends to
increase external demand for a country’s sovereign debt, but Fitch categorises the
variable in its External Finances section of the SRM. The RCF indicator is based on hard
data (from the IMF COFER database) so as to avoid subjective judgements.4
•Sovereign net foreign assets (SNFAs) – A measure of the government’s financial
position with respect to the rest of the world is the net foreign asset/debt position of the
sovereign. Sovereign net foreign assets are defined as official central bank foreign-
exchange reserves plus other sovereign external assets less sovereign external debt.
Other sovereign external assets include sovereign-controlled external assets (for

In assessing reserve-currency characteristics, Fitch uses data from the IMF’s COFER database (updated
quarterly with a four-month lag) to determine the share of currencies in global reserve portfolios. This
currently includes eight currencies: the US dollar, euro, yen, pound, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, the
Swiss franc and the Chinese yuan. Fitch gives each country in the eurozone the same RCF score in the SRM
(which only includes hard data), but can make adjustments in the QO to recognise that not all countries in
the eurozone have the same degree of RCF. The agency does not attribute RCF to countries that are
simply dollarised or euroised rather than being members of currency areas with benefits, such as access to
central bank liquidity.

example held by sovereign wealth funds or public pension funds) that are sufficiently
liquid and could support fiscal and current account funding. Such equity, debt or other
assets would normally be included only if data on holdings over time are available from
official sources or can reasonably be estimated by Fitch. Sovereign external debt would
include liabilities held by non-residents issued by the government, the central bank and
other sovereign entities (including sovereign wealth funds (SWF)).
•Commodity dependence – The greater the reliance on commodities for export receipts,
the greater the vulnerability to terms-of-trade or other shocks and, other things being
equal, the weaker is sovereign creditworthiness. This is particularly the case when the
country depends mainly on a single commodity (or service such as tourism) rather than
a basket of commodities that offers more diversification. This variable is calculated as
the proportion of current external receipts that are non‐manufactured goods. Following
the World Bank definition, in which such data are available, Fitch uses Standard
International Trade Classification (SITC) Revision 3 data and we define manufactured
goods as categories 5 (chemicals) plus 6 (basic manufactures, excluding 68 - non-ferrous
metals), 7 (machinery & transport equipment), and 8 (miscellaneous manufactured
articles). When such data are available, re-exports are excluded from the calculation for
non‐manufactured goods exports in order to focus on commodity endowments.
•Foreign-exchange reserves – The level of international foreign-exchange reserves
accumulated by the country’s central bank represents an important buffer or measure
of resilience to shocks for countries that do not benefit from RCF. Expressed as the
number of months of cover of import payments, this variable highlights the extent to
which the economy can continue to finance its imports in the absence of access to
external funding. It is also instructive with respect to assessing a country’s ability to meet
its external debt service in foreign currency. In terms of the country’s exchange rate, the
level of international reserves can also be an important factor in determining exchange
rate policy, as managed or pegged exchange rates will require a certain level of foreign-
exchange reserves to be credible.
•External interest service – Substantial external debt servicing and refinancing needs
increase the vulnerability of the balance of payments and economy to external shocks,
such as episodes of volatility in international capital markets. They may also imply a high
or costly external debt burden and that the economy will require a surplus on its trade in
goods and (non-factor) services to service its debt. Fitch also assesses the sustainability
of the external debt burden through the debt service ratio (repayments of principal on
medium- and long-term external debt plus gross interest payments on all external debt
relative to Current External Receipts (CXR)).
•Current account balance + net inward foreign direct investment – A large current
account deficit (relative to the size of the economy and CXR) can be a source of risk to
macroeconomic stability. This is particularly the case if it is financed by potentially
volatile capital flows, such as portfolio capital and short-term debt, and international
borrowing that can lead to a rising external debt burden rather than equity foreign direct
investment (FDI). A “sudden stop” in financing for a current account deficit can
precipitate a currency devaluation or recession, which might have a negative impact on
creditworthiness. The current account of the balance of payments is a record of a
country’s current transactions with non-residents. FDI is typically a less risky form of
financing as it is equity (rather than debt) or inter-company loans (which are typically
rolled over) and is often associated with investment that increases a country’s
productive capacity rather than consumption.
•Fitch examines the underlying drivers and main components of the current account
(such as exports and imports of goods and services, income payments and private
transfers including remittances) to identify strengths and weaknesses. When
remittances are an important source of external receipts, Fitch will assess their volatility
and potential vulnerability to shocks. It will also consider the current account balance
from the perspective of national savings and investment balances, competitiveness, and
whether a current account deficit reflects public- or private-sector deficits.

QO Rationale
QO factors – relative to SRM data and output
•External financing flexibility, reflecting the resilience and range of external financing sources for the
economy, eg record of market access by domestic borrowers in international markets at sustainable
yields and long maturities, access to other sources of external financing (including assets held in
sovereign wealth funds), availability of explicit or implicit guarantees or other forms of support by
foreign governments or multilateral institutions and the liquidity position.
•External debt sustainability, reflecting the extent of any external imbalances that may have
developed and the level, trend and structure of external debt and assets.
•Vulnerability to shocks, reflecting the potential for events to crystallise weaknesses in the structure
of external finances.
Source: Fitch Ratings
The rationale for the inclusion of these QO factors is as follows:
•
External financing flexibility
-Record of market access – Fitch assesses the record of market access by a country’s
borrowers in international markets as a qualitative indicator of the resilience of its
external debt service capacity, particularly at times of severe stress. It will consider
whether the yield, maturity, currency and holders of external borrowing give rise
to or indicate vulnerability to sustained market access. It will also consider the
potential availability of alternative sources of financing such as from multilateral
institutions. When a country (either the sovereign and/or parts of the private
sector) has lost market access in the past or is judged to have relatively weak
financing flexibility, Fitch makes an adjustment in the QO. This is particularly the
case for countries in the eurozone, which benefit from the common eurozone RCF
in the SRM. Fitch will consider potential downward notching in situations in which
the sovereign has limited or no market access, although the propensity to notch
down for this reason will be lower for low non-investment-grade sovereigns, where
market access may naturally be more limited.
-Resilience of external financing flows – For those countries with managed
exchange rate regimes and which are already heavily indebted (and hence likely
to be credit constrained), Fitch will put additional emphasis in its rating analysis
on the resilience of external financing flows (e.g. the likelihood of policy-
conditional funding from the IFIs) and whether ex ante external financing needs
are likely to be met. The availability of explicit or implicit guarantees or other
forms of support by foreign governments or multilateral institutions will also be
considered here. Moreover, previous episodes of private capital flight will weigh
negatively on the rating analysis.
-Support between sovereigns - Fitch will reflect support from other sovereigns into
the rating when it is judged to be sufficiently likely and provided that the impact
is sufficiently material. Likelihood of timely support will typically depend on
factors such as the strength of commitment made by the donor, and its capacity
and incentive to provide or continue to provide support. The materiality of the
impact on the rating will depend on the magnitude of support and how effectively
it is used. Each potential case will have specific circumstances and a different
counter-factual (including whether it is already captured in the SRM, and
whether it serves to improve creditworthiness or prevent deterioration).
-International liquidity ratio – A good measure of an economy’s vulnerability to
external financing shocks arising from maturity mismatches on its external
balance sheet is Fitch’s International Liquidity Ratio (ILR). The ILR expresses the
stock of the banking system’s liquid foreign assets (including the central bank
international reserves) relative to liquid foreign liabilities, including non-resident
holdings of local-currency debt irrespective of maturity, as well as external debt
with a residual maturity of less than one year. An ILR of greater than ‘1’
(expressed in Fitch sovereign credit research as 100%) implies that the stock of

Global
short-term and liquid external liabilities is exceeded by the stock of short-term
and liquid foreign assets, providing a cushion against temporary closure of
international capital markets.
-
•
•
Sovereign wealth funds – Fitch can make an adjustment in its QO when it
considers external assets held by SWF or pension funds to be sufficiently large
and liquid to provide a benefit to external financing flexibility beyond that
captured in the reserve coverage variable, or when insufficient data prevent their
incorporation in the SNFA variable, but Fitch is able to make an acceptable
approximation of the size of the assets.
External debt sustainability
-External solvency – A heavy external debt burden will be, other things being equal,
associated with a greater risk of default, balance-of-payments crisis or exchange
rate crisis. However, what constitutes a sustainable external debt burden varies
across countries and over time, and hence there is no simple linear relationship
between it and sovereign creditworthiness and ratings (this is why it is not
statistically significant and not included in the SRM). Nonetheless, Fitch believes
it is an important factor affecting creditworthiness so includes it in the QO.
-Net external debt – A principal measure of external solvency is based on the
concept of net external debt (i.e. the difference between gross external debt and
residents’ debt claims on non-residents) relative to GDP and CXR. The emphasis
on net rather than gross measures of external debt is because as economies
become more internationalised, the stock of foreign assets and liabilities,
including debt, may increase. As such, high and rising gross external debt does
not necessarily imply a deterioration in the country’s overall external position if
matched by a corresponding increase in foreign assets. Fitch also looks at the
country’s net international investment position (IIP), which includes equity as
well as debt investments. When there are no official IIP data available,
alternative data proxies and sources may be used.
-External debt sustainability factors – As well as the level of net external debt, Fitch
will consider its dynamics, drivers and structure. A rapidly rising net external
debt ratio poses more risks than a stable one, particularly if trends in the current
account or its financing do not suggest a stabilisation on current policies or in the
foreseeable future. Fitch can make an adjustment in its QO when large sovereign
external assets, for example in SWFs or pension funds, provide a level of
confidence on external debt sustainability beyond what is captured in the SNFA
variable.
Vulnerability to shocks
-Balance-sheet structure can increase vulnerability – The structure of the country’s
external balance sheet in terms of its currency, maturity and distribution by
sector of the economy or the concentration or exposures of its creditors can
make it more susceptible and vulnerable to shocks.
-Exogenous shocks – Adverse shocks to key industries (not captured already in
commodity dependence), trade partners, creditors, capital markets or
unforeseen events can affect the resilience of a country’s balance of payments
and capacity to meet its external debt service obligations. If these are material
and not captured elsewhere in its analytical framework, Fitch will make an
adjustment in the QO to reflect their impact or risk.

Sovereign FC and LC Ratings
Fitch assigns LT FC and LC IDRs to sovereigns and ratings to specific debt instruments issued
by sovereigns according to its published rating definitions.
Local-Currency Versus Foreign-Currency IDRs
In Fitch’s view, the LC and FC credit profiles for any given sovereign are typically
indistinguishable at investment-grade level, i.e. ‘BBB-’ and above. Consequently, subject to the
guidance below, we typically expect to equalise LC and FC IDRs and associated debt obligation
ratings for investment-grade sovereigns. For non-investment-grade sovereigns, the potential
for divergent credit profiles is greater, particularly for sovereigns that are in or approaching
distress, i.e. at the ‘CCC+’ level and below.
The table below summarises the range of potential relationships between the LC and FC ratings
assigned to sovereign issuers.

Factors Affecting LC Versus FC Notching
As indicated above, the factors that have an influence on the level of notching, if any, of the LC
IDR relative to the FC IDR fall into the following broad categories. These particularly apply in
situations in which the primary constraint on the sovereign ratings stems from vulnerabilities in
external finances or when Fitch judges that the sovereign is likely to extend preferential
treatment to LC creditors.
•
Strong existing and expected public finance fundamentals relative to external finance
fundamentals is a key factor supporting notching of an LC IDR above the FC IDR.

Sovereigns
Global
•Fitch’s expectations of likely preferential treatment of LC or FC debt is a key factor.
This might reflect the sovereign’s debt repayment record or an otherwise strong
rationale for either LC or FC creditors to be preferred.
•An established domestic capital market that is an ample and reliable source of fiscal
funding in local currency at relatively low cost and medium-to-long maturities is a
supporting factor in notching an LC IDR above the FC IDR.
•An established record of low and stable inflation, reflected in the absence of inflation
indexation and relatively high levels of monetisation, supports monetary flexibility and
hence is a supporting factor in notching the LC IDR above the FC IDR.
•The degree of flexibility a sovereign maintains in managing its exchange rate may
affect the notching of its LC IDR. Sovereigns with a currency board arrangement, that
are members of a common currency area or use the currency of another country, for
example, would receive no LC IDR uplift. Freely floating, own-currency regimes,
meanwhile would represent a supporting factor in notching the LC IDR above the FC
IDR.
•LC v FC debt burdens will influence the extent to which either LC or FC IDRs can be
notched higher than each other. A proportionately higher LC debt burden compared
with the FC debt burden will tend to lead to lower notching for the LC IDR and vice-
versa. This would be a supporting factor.

Rarely, when LC debt burden is much higher than FC debt and/or Fitch judges that
FC creditors are likely to be preferred to LC creditors. Also, would typically expect
domestic capital markets to be shallow/illiquid and inflation high/volatile.
Source: Fitch Ratings
Other considerations within the criteria in the context of assigning LC and FC ratings are as
follow:
Ability to default selectively – Compared with non-sovereign entities that are subject to the
bankruptcy and legal regimes in the jurisdiction(s) in which they operate, the sovereign has
much greater scope to default selectively. The most relevant distinction from a sovereign credit
perspective is between foreign and local obligations in terms of currency denomination of debt
(see above), though the market in which it is issued and the predominance of holder (ie resident
versus non-resident) are also factors that can result in differences in the ratings assigned to debt
instruments in the same currency. Consequently, though the same obligor, there can be a rating
distinction between debt denominated and payable in foreign and local currency.
Sovereign access to foreign currency dependent on economy – Sovereigns typically receive
nearly all of their income (taxes, charges) in local currency; the exceptions are commodity
producers and dollarised economies. Consequently, for external debt servicing they must
purchase foreign currency in the foreign-exchange market (or from the central bank) or borrow it.
The government’s access to foreign currency therefore depends on the economy’s (rather than
the sovereign’s) capacity to generate foreign currency and the willingness of market participants
to exchange it for local currency – and, if unwilling, the government’s capacity to expropriate it.

Local-currency debt not immune to default – In contrast, not only are tax and other receipts in
local currency, but most sovereign governments through the central bank have ultimate control
over the domestic money supply and in theory could print currency to fund themselves, albeit
not indefinitely and at the cost of high inflation. Although many sovereigns have preferential
access to domestic capital markets, which can be a more reliable source of funding than
international capital markets, especially during periods of distress, it remains entirely feasible
for sovereigns to default on local-currency debt, and there have been numerous examples of
such defaults in the past two decades (see the latest Sovereign Transition and Default Study).

Sovereign Short-Term Ratings
Similar to other Corporate Finance ratings, Fitch’s ST IDRs or obligation ratings for sovereigns are
based in all cases on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or security and relate
to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the
relevant obligation, using a scale between ‘F1+’ and ‘D’. Short-term ratings are assigned to obligations
whose initial maturity is viewed as short-term based on market convention.
Short-Term Local- and Foreign-Currency Ratings
For sovereigns, ST ratings are determined from LT ratings according to Fitch’s standard rating
correspondence table. ST FC IDRs are determined from LT FC IDRs, and ST LC IDRs are
determined from LT LC IDRs. The factors that are relevant for differentials between LC and FC
LT ratings are also often relevant for ST ratings, so it does not necessarily make sense to always
equalise FC and LC ST ratings.
Source: Fitch Ratings
Fitch would not as a matter of course rate all ST LC IDRs at ‘F1+’ for the same reason that it does
not rate all LT LC IDRs at ‘AAA’: sovereigns can and do default on local-currency debt5.
The rating correspondence table in the sidebar margin provides two possible options for ST
ratings at five LT rating levels: ‘A+’ (to ‘F1’ or ‘F1+’), ‘A’ (to ‘F1’ or ‘F1+’), ‘A−’ (to ‘F2’ or ‘F1’),
‘BBB+’ (to ‘F2’ or ‘F1’) and ‘BBB’ (to ‘F3’ or ‘F2’). According to Fitch Rating Definitions, the Fitch
Rating Correspondence Table is “a guide only and variations from this correspondence will
occur”6. However, Fitch would expect variations to be rare in the case of sovereign ratings. At
‘RD’/’D’ LT rating levels there are three possible options that include ‘C’ to capture the event
described in the section Treatment of Long-Term and Short-Term IDRs in Default above.
In order to foster transparency, predictability and consistency, Fitch has introduced some
simple guidelines for the ‘mapping’ from LT to ST ratings when there is this option, set out below.
Mapping for Local-Currency Ratings
Fitch will choose the higher of the two options for all ST LC ratings.
ST LC ratings are inherently about liquidity and financing flexibility. A sovereign’s powers of
money creation and capacity to ensure preferential market access (for example through
regulation and “financial repression”) mean its financing flexibility and short-term
creditworthiness will typically be high relative to other entities (such as banks and corporates)
at similar LT LC IDRs.

Even if a sovereign has its own currency and a compliant central bank and could print enough money to
service its debts, it may not do so as hyperinflation is a costly option.

Sovereigns
Global
Mapping for Foreign-Currency Ratings
Fitch will choose the higher of the two options, if:
•The sovereign has an RCF score greater than zero. Countries with reserve currencies
enjoy comparatively strong financial and policy flexibility and the authorities would be
able to exchange local currency for other major currencies to meet any FX debt service
due; or
•Fitch assesses that the sovereign has a robust international liquidity position. The main
indicator that we will use to make that assessment is the Fitch International Liquidity
Ratio (ILR). We will typically assess the liquidity position as sufficiently robust if the ratio
is at least 100% for the current year. This implies that the stock of liquid external assets
exceeds the stock of short-term external liabilities, providing confidence about the
sovereign’s ability to meet its external payment obligations even in the event of a
temporary closure of international capital markets.
Otherwise, we will choose the lower of the two options.
Fitch may also take into account other indicators in its assessment of the robustness of a
country’s international liquidity position. This would particularly be the case if the liquidity ratio
was close to 100% or there were gaps in the data. For example, a sovereign rating committee
might decide to affirm a country’s ST FC IDR if its liquidity ratio moved just above or just below
the 100% mark from one rating review to the next (rather than upgrade or downgrade it),
particularly if the change was expected to be temporary, for example owing to an unusually
heavy/light amortisation schedule that year or to valuation effects related, for example, to
official foreign exchange reserves (the liquidity ratio is calculated in US dollars).
Given that the ILR is a variable that on occasion can be estimated based on certain assumptions
and/or subject to fluctuations from year to year, it is possible that the implementation of this
guidance could introduce a somewhat higher level of volatility into short-term sovereign
ratings. In view of the nature of short-term ratings, the agency feels that this is not an
unreasonable outcome.
Rating Through the Cycle
Fitch aims for its sovereign ratings to be consistent through time as well as across countries.
In terms of the former, Fitch distinguishes in its analysis of public and external finances between
“cyclical” and “structural” developments and trends, for example by taking account of estimates
(if available) of cyclically adjusted budget balances. This is consistent with our approach of rating
through the economic cycle.
Peer Analysis
Quantitative indicators – Variables relating to sovereign creditworthiness are compared
across countries and over time. Measures of quantitative indicators of sovereign
creditworthiness by rating category (e.g. the ‘BBB’ category would consist of ‘BBB-’, ‘BBB’ and
‘BBB+’) are regularly updated.
Importance of qualitative factors – It is evident, however, that there is not a simple linear
relationship between sovereign ratings and every metric that Fitch considers in its rating
analysis. In part, this merely reflects the multivariate nature of the analysis such that the
relationship between, for example, the government debt burden and the sovereign rating is
conditioned on a range of other variables, such as income per head. But it also in part reflects
qualitative factors that influence the ability and willingness of a sovereign to honour its financial
obligations.
These “intangible” influences on sovereign creditworthiness in part explain why “advanced
economies” are able to sustain a much higher debt burden, even after taking into account per
capita income. The importance of these qualitative factors explains the relevance of Fitch’s QO
used in tandem with the SRM to arrive at the sovereign’s LT FC IDR. These factors, together
with the quantitative variables contained in the SRM, are set out in detail in each of the sections
above covering the four analytical pillars (structural features, macroeconomic, public finances,
external finances).

Variations from Criteria
Fitch’s criteria are designed to be used in conjunction with experienced analytical judgement
exercised through a committee process. The combination of transparent criteria, analytical
judgement applied on a transaction-by-transaction or issuer-by-issuer basis, and full disclosure
via rating commentary strengthens Fitch’s rating process while assisting market participants in
understanding the analysis behind our ratings.
A rating committee may adjust the application of these criteria to reflect the risks of a specific
transaction or entity. Such adjustments are called variations. All variations will be disclosed in
the respective rating action commentaries, including their impact on the rating when
appropriate.
A variation can be approved by a ratings committee when the risk, feature, or other factor
relevant to the assignment of a rating and the methodology applied to it are both included within
the scope of the criteria, but when the analysis described in the criteria requires modification to
address factors specific to the particular transaction or entity.
Disclosures
Fitch discloses the following information in each of its published Sovereign Rating Action
Commentaries (with the exception of FC IDRs rated ‘CCC+’ and below):
•SRM output in the form of an LT FC IDR;
•QO rating adjustment to arrive at the final published LT FC IDR; and
•details of situations in which Fitch decides not to adopt the SRM output as the starting
point for its rating assignment in line with the provisions in these criteria outlined under
Conditions and Exceptions to Application of SRM and QO.
Rating Assumption Sensitivity
Fitch’s opinions expressed in its sovereign ratings are forward-looking and reflect the agency’s
views on current and potential future credit developments. Sovereign ratings can be subject to
positive or negative rating actions based on, but not limited to, the factors set out below, which
reflect the core pillars of these rating criteria and are the primary sensitivities that can influence
the ratings and/or Outlook. Such rating actions can be informed by the Sovereign Rating Model
or the Qualitative Overlay or a combination of both.
Structural Features: Changes in the structure of the economy that render it more or less
vulnerable to shocks, including the risks posed by the financial sector, political developments
and risks, governance quality and institutional strength.
Macroeconomic Performance, Policies and Prospects: Changes in a country’s macroeconomic
performance, particularly in its ability to generate robust and stable growth without creating
imbalances, or changes in the quality and credibility of its policy framework.
Public Finances: Changes in the robustness of a country’s public finances, reflected in the
evolution of its fiscal balance, the structure and sustainability of government debt and fiscal
financing, and the likelihood of crystallisation of contingent liabilities.
External Finances: Changes in the robustness and sustainability of external balances and flows,
including current account balances, foreign-exchange reserves and capital flows, and the level
and structure of the country’s external debt.

Appendix 2: Sovereign Debt Instruments
Fitch would expect to rate senior unsecured bonds that constitute a direct, general,
unconditional and unsubordinated obligation of the sovereign and rank pari passu with other
senior obligations of the issuer at the same level as the issuer IDR, except for guaranteed bonds,
or in the cases described in the section Sovereign Default Events.
In addition to global notes, there are different types of senior unsecured debt instruments
issued by sovereigns that typically carry the same rating as the issuer on a local- or foreign-
currency basis. See the table below for examples.
Fitch does not assign Recovery Ratings to sovereign debt instruments.
Examples of Sovereign Debt Instruments
• Inflation-linked bonds: These are indexed to inflation so that the principal and/or interest
payments can rise and fall with the rate of inflation. They will generally carry the rating of
the LC IDR even when there are no principal protection mechanisms in place to safeguard
principal payments against deflation.
• Deferrable notes: The terms of these bonds, expected to be issued only by lowly rated
sovereigns, allow for interest and/or principal deferral. They may carry the issuer IDR if the
deferrals are triggered by a set of pre-defined events (for example linked to catastrophic
events such as natural disasters), andthe amounts deferred are expected to accrue interest
and no haircut of face value is contemplated. Fitch would also expect that the deferral
period does not significantly extend the final maturity.
• Green or sustainability-linked bonds: Proceeds are used for eligible green projects or
positive social outcomes that may carry step-up or down coupon payments linked to the
achievement of predetermined enviromental goals.
• Dual-currency structures: These are bonds denominated in local currency but their
repayment is specified in foreign currency so that the market exchange rate risk is borne by
the bondholder. Fitch will assign an FC rating as the sovereign’s capacity (and willingness)
to make payments in foreign currency is the same as if the debt was denominated in foreign
currency. Similarly, debt issued in local capital markets but denominated and payable in
foreign currency is assigned an FC rating. Conversely, bonds denominated in foreign
currency but repayable in local currency are assigned an LC rating.
• Global depositary notes: An LC international rating will be assigned in cases where the
underlying issuance is denominated in local currency but the terms and conditions allow for
repayment/settlement in foreign currency at the prevailing exchange rate at the time of
repayment.
• Guaranteed debt instruments: As mentioned above, Fitch does not assign Recovery Ratings
to sovereign debt instruments. However, occasionally, sovereign issuances may
incorporate a third-party guarantee. In those cases, the rating of the instrument can
incorporate an uplift from the sovereign’s IDR based on recovery prospects from the
guarantee. Those instruments will be rated in conjunction with the Third-Party Partial Credit
Support Rating Criteria, where the notching approach for recoveries is described.
Guaranteed obligations of a defaulted sovereign are typically rated in the ‘CCC’ to ‘C’ rating
categories in line with the rating definitions for corporate finance obligations and
depending on their recovery prospects determined by the Third-Party Partial Credit Support
Rating Criteria.

Appendix 3: Macro-Prudential Indicator Model
MPI Score Definition
Fitch’s MPI score provides an indicator of the build-up of potential stress in banking systems
that could materialise up to three years after an early warning is first indicated. The score, which
is on a scale from 1 to 3, is an output from the agency’s Macro-Prudential Indicator Model.
The model contains separate modules for Emerging Markets (EMs) and Developed Markets
(DMs). In both cases, four input variables are used – private-sector credit, real effective
exchange rate (RER), real equity prices and real property prices. Scores defined as follows:
•MPI 1 indicates low vulnerability to potential systemic stress, meaning private-sector
credit data are below trigger thresholds.
•MPI 2 indicates moderate vulnerability, triggered by excessive real private-sector credit
growth (for EMs) or private-sector credit/GDP levels (for DMs) alone. None of the RER,
real property price or real equity price indicators is above trigger thresholds.
•MPI 2* indicates moderate vulnerability (as above), accompanied by severe data
limitations that may hide latent risks. If the missing data were available, the higher MPI 3
score might be triggered. The asterisk denotes that at least two data series are unavailable.
•MPI 3 indicates high vulnerability, triggered by excessive real credit growth (for EMs) or
credit/GDP levels (for DMs), and at least one further trigger (either RER, real equity
prices or real property prices).
Model Limitations
The success rate of the model can, in part, be measured by the number of crises correctly
anticipated in the model estimation period. This is over 70% for DMs and 50% for EMs.
However, this type of early warning analysis inevitably gives rise to some false positives and
false negatives. The calibration of the trigger thresholds is intended to minimise these errors
while maintaining an acceptable success rate. Likewise, the setting of the input time horizon is
designed to be long enough to take into account the time it can take for banking system stress
to emerge, but not so long as to reduce the indicator’s analytical usefulness. The ratio of correct
signals to false alarms is 50%. The resulting MPI scores can therefore only be a starting point for
Fitch’s in-depth country and banking system analysis.
All the data, especially for EMs, are subject to sometimes major revisions, can be volatile and are
difficult to forecast. Consequently, scores are subject to change as data are revised and
forecasts are firmed up.
The scope of the model covers only one potential source of banking crises, namely those
associated with excessively fast credit growth.
Deviations Model for Developed Markets
For DMs (equivalent to the IMF’s “Advanced Economies”), the MPI score is derived from the
deviation of key variables from trend. Here, the four input variables are the ratio of private-
sector credit/GDP and indexes for the RER, real equity prices and real property prices. Trends
are derived from as long a time series as is available, using a Hodrick-Prescott filter, but are
sensitive to the development of actual data and will change over time. Due to the need to review
actual data against stable long-term trends, Fitch does not include RER, equity price or house
price data when less than 15 years’ data is available. The assessment is based on three years of
annual data.
High vulnerability to potential systemic stress is designated MPI 3 and is defined as:
•a ratio of private-sector credit/GDP more than 5pp above trend in a single year; and
•at least one of the asset price or exchange rate indicators triggering:
-real property prices more than 17% above trend in the same year; or
-real equity prices more than 50% above trend (two years previously); or
-RER more than 15% above trend in the same year.

35

<!-- page 36 -->
Sovereigns
Global
Moderate vulnerability (MPI 2) occurs when the credit/GDP ratio is above its trigger value,
whatever the other indicators may show. An MPI score of ‘1’ denotes low potential vulnerability.
Changes Model for Emerging Markets
For EMs, the focus is on real-terms percentage changes in the key variables. This primarily
reflects our prior finding that percentage changes yielded a greater success rate for MPI signals
than the deviation from trend methodology. In addition, EMs often have less reliable time series
data that are available over shorter periods, in particular with respect to property and equity
prices. This makes the data less amenable to the trend analysis used in the deviations model.
Although data coverage has improved considerably, absence of longer time series data for
historical periods impedes the assessment of success rates on past crises.
Here, the four input variables are private-sector credit growth, RER growth, real equity price
growth and real property price growth. The assessment is based on three successive pairs of
annual data. A trigger in any two-year period is relevant to a country’s MPI score.
High vulnerability to potential systemic stress is designated MPI 3 and is defined as:
•real private-sector credit growth exceeding an average 15% a year over two years; and
•at least one of the asset price or exchange rate indicators triggering:
-real property price growth of more than 5% each year in the same period; or
-real equity price growth of more than 17% each year (in the preceding two years);
or
-real effective exchange rate appreciation of more than 4% each year in the same
period.
Moderate vulnerability (MPI 2) occurs when real private-sector credit growth exceeds the
trigger 15%, whatever the other indicators may show. An MPI score of ‘1’ denotes low potential
vulnerability.

Appendix 4: Data Sources, Limitations and Reasonable
Investigation
Data Sources
These criteria, Fitch’s sovereign analysis and rating decisions are based on relevant information
available to its analysts. The sources of this information are the issuer and the public domain.
This includes relevant publicly available information on the issuer, such as financial and
economic data published by national authorities and international agencies, as well as
regulatory filings. Data used in both Fitch’s Rating Action Commentaries (RACs) and Rating
Reports (RRs) will be correct as at the time of publication, albeit potentially subject to
subsequent revision in the event that data are adjusted ex-post. The rating process can also
incorporate information provided by third-party sources. If this information is material to the
rating or a specific rating action, Fitch will disclose the relevant source in its written
commentary with respect to such rating or rating action.
While key data and information are subject to critical review by Fitch, such as cross-checking
with third-party sources when available, the agency relies on the accuracy and reliability of
information published by national authorities and international agencies, as well as the veracity
of the information provided directly by representatives of the sovereign. Moreover, for some
countries, broad economic and financial data that is typically incorporated in Fitch’s sovereign
credit and rating analysis have material shortcomings in terms of reliability and coverage. Such
data limitations, when judged to be material, are noted in Fitch’s sovereign RACs and FRRs and
are taken into account by the rating committee when assigning sovereign ratings. However,
Fitch does not assign sovereign ratings if it judges that the data limitations are so great as to
render any analysis insufficiently robust to support a rating opinion.
Limitations
Ratings, including Rating Watches and Outlooks, assigned by Fitch are subject to the
limitations specified in Fitch’s Ratings Definitions,
In addition, ratings within the scope of these criteria are subject to the following specific
limitations: Reported failure to pay debt owed to other governments and official creditors by
the sovereign, including multilateral institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank will not be
considered a default event within these criteria.
Reasonable Investigation
When assigning and maintaining sovereign ratings, Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of
the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its rating criteria and obtains
reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent that such
sources are available for a given sovereign issuer.

Appendix 5: Sovereign Ratings and ESG
Fitch seeks to reflect relevant environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors into its
sovereign ratings, as it does for all factors that it believes are relevant and material for
creditworthiness.
Governance has always been an integral part of Fitch’s sovereign credit analysis, underscored
by the World Bank’s Worldwide Governance Indicators having the highest weight of any
variable in the SRM. Many social factors also directly or indirectly affect many of the SRM
variables and QO factors. In general, for sovereign issuers environmental factors are typically a
lesser influence on current ratings. As climate change becomes more material, it is likely to
become a more important influence on sovereign ratings.
Climate Change
Climate change is gradually starting to have an effect on sovereign creditworthiness. However,
analysis of the potential impact is embryonic and the uncertainties are very high.
There are several elements to assessing sovereigns’ exposure to climate change.
•‘Physical’ risks include the potential impact of higher temperatures, increasing drought,
rising sea levels and more extreme weather events.
•‘Transition’ risks include exposure to potentially ‘stranded assets’ (such as fossil fuel
resources that might never be utilised owing to a transition to a greener economy), for
example driven by changes in global policies, technology or consumer preferences, and
the costs of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy.
•Adaption capacities of sovereigns to partially offset adverse effects of climate change,
for example through deploying resources and know-how to limit physical risks or
diversifying economies to limit transition risks.
Ex-post, the impact of some aspects of climate change such as increased incidents and intensity
of extreme weather events or reduced fiscal and external revenues from fossil fuels will be at
least partially captured in SRM variables such as GDP growth and the public and external
finances.
Some SRM variables also have some correlation with ex-ante climate change risks, including
share in world GDP (which captures diversification and resilience to shocks), GDP per capita
and governance indicators (which capture some aspects of adaption and mitigation capacity)
and commodity dependence (which may capture some aspects of ‘stranded asset’ risk). Fitch can
also use the QO to make forward-looking rating adjustments when it believes that the risk of
climate change is sufficiently relevant and material to sovereign creditworthiness.
Uncertainties over the extent of and impact of climate change are very high. To generate robust
quantitative assessments of the exposures of different sovereigns would, amongst other
factors, require further analysis or assumptions on:
•future international policy actions related to greenhouse gas emissions;
•the effect of the resulting concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere on
global temperatures and sea levels (“representative concentration pathway”) and the
distribution of risks around the base case;
•consequential sovereign exposure to country-level changes in temperature, drought,
sea levels, extreme weather, and holdings of potentially stranded assets;
•the likely effectiveness of adaptation strategies;
•the impact of all these potential climate and policy developments on variables that affect
sovereign creditworthiness such as GDP, the public and external finances and political risk;
•relevant time and rating horizons: most of the more severe impact from climate change
is expected to only build up over several decades, while current ratings decisions will
typically place more weight on current developments than uncertain long-term
projections, in the same way that we factor in other long-term risks such as demographic
trends and unfunded pension liabilities.
Analysis and data are moving forward rapidly. Fitch will continue to seek to capture risks related
to climate change in its sovereign ratings more fully over time.

limitations and disclaimers by following this link: https://www.fitchratings.com/understandingcreditratings. In
addition, the following https://www.fitchratings.com/rating-definitions-document details Fitch's rating
definitions for each rating scale and rating categories, including definitions relating to default. Published ratings,
criteria, and methodologies are available from this site at all times. Fitch's code of conduct, confidentiality, conflicts
of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance, and other relevant policies and procedures are also available from the
Code of Conduct section of this site. Directors and shareholders’ relevant interests are available at

is based in an ESMA- or FCA-registered Fitch Ratings company (or branch of such a company) can be found on the
entity summary page for this issuer on the Fitch Ratings website.
In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives
from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual
information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from
independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual
investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the
requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and
nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party
verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other
reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular
security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that
neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection
with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information
they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the
work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters.
Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions
about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts
can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.
The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant
that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the
creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is
continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of
individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless
such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals
identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact
purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented
to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any
reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or
hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-
exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors,
and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per
issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or
guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in
connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the
United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution,

337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not intended to

Fitch Ratings, Inc. is registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization
(the "NRSRO"). While certain of the NRSRO's credit rating subsidiaries are listed on Item 3 of Form NRSRO and as such are authorized to issue
credit ratings on behalf of the NRSRO (see https://www.fitchratings.com/site/regulatory), other credit rating subsidiaries are not listed on
Form NRSRO (the "non-NRSROs") and therefore credit ratings issued by those subsidiaries are not issued on behalf of the NRSRO. However,
non-NRSRO personnel may participate in determining credit ratings issued by or on behalf of the NRSRO.
